This the action where you'll add any app content (such as a React root element). This is basically where all HTML goes that is in the body tag (minus script tags).

Example. Say I've got a React app and all I need (minus my scripts) is a single div for my app to instantiate itself: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/benrgreene/d6efef21d2f94a2d2f4eeb68a54414d1.js?file=action-body.php"></script>
